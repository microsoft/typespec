## Introduction

In this section, we'll focus on creating custom response models and demonstrate how to use them in your API operations. We'll also incorporate predefined response models from the TypeSpec HTTP library.

## Introduction to Custom Response Models

Custom response models allow you to define structured responses for your API operations. They help ensure consistency and clarity in your API responses. TypeSpec defines response models for common HTTP responses in the [HTTP library](https://typespec.io/docs/libraries/http/reference), which we can incorporate into our custom response models.

### Common HTTP Status Codes and TypeSpec Response Models

Here are some common HTTP status codes and their equivalent TypeSpec response models from the TypeSpec HTTP library:

| **HTTP Status Code** | **Meaning**                                                                 | **TypeSpec Response Model** |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 200 OK               | The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource. | `OkResponse`                |
| 201 Created          | The request was successful, and a new resource was created.                 | `CreatedResponse`           |
| 204 No Content       | The request was successful, but there is no content to return.              | `NoContentResponse`         |
| 400 Bad Request      | The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.          | `BadRequestResponse`        |
| 401 Unauthorized     | The client must authenticate itself to get the requested response.          | `UnauthorizedResponse`      |
| 403 Forbidden        | The client does not have access rights to the content.                      | `ForbiddenResponse`         |
| 404 Not Found        | The server cannot find the requested resource.                              | `NotFoundResponse`          |

### Benefits of Using Custom Response Models

- **Reducing Duplication**: By defining common response structures once, you can reuse them across multiple operations.
- **Improving Readability**: Custom response models make your API definitions clearer and easier to understand.
- **Minimizing Errors**: Consistent response models help reduce the likelihood of errors in your API responses.

## Creating Custom Response Models

Let's start by defining and extending some custom response models. These models will incorporate existing response models from the TypeSpec HTTP library to ensure consistency.

### Example: Defining and Extending Custom Response Models

```tsp
model PetListResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<Pet[]>;
}

model PetResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<Pet>;
}

model PetCreatedResponse {
  ...CreatedResponse;
  ...Body<Pet>;
}

model PetErrorResponse {
  ...BadRequestResponse;
  ...Body<ValidationError>;
}

model PetNotFoundResponse {
  ...NotFoundResponse;
  ...Body<NotFoundError>;
}

model PetUnauthorizedResponse {
  ...UnauthorizedResponse;
  ...Body<UnauthorizedError>;
}

model PetSuccessResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<string>;
}

model PetNoContentResponse {
  ...NoContentResponse;
}
```

In this example:

- `PetListResponse` extends `OkResponse` and includes a body with an array of `Pet` objects.
- `PetResponse` extends `OkResponse` and includes a body with a single `Pet` object.
- `PetCreatedResponse` extends `CreatedResponse` and includes a body with a newly created `Pet` object.
- `PetErrorResponse` extends `BadRequestResponse` and includes a body with a `ValidationError` object.
- `PetNotFoundResponse` extends `NotFoundResponse` and includes a body with a `NotFoundError` object.
- `PetUnauthorizedResponse` extends `UnauthorizedResponse` and includes a body with an `UnauthorizedError` object.
- `PetSuccessResponse` extends `OkResponse` and includes a body with a success message.
- `PetNoContentResponse` extends `NoContentResponse` for situations where the request succeeded but there is no content to return.

**Note**: Base response models like `OkResponse`, `CreatedResponse`, `BadRequestResponse`, `NotFoundResponse`, and `UnauthorizedResponse` are imported from the TypeSpec [HTTP data types library](../../libraries/http/reference/data-types), which we're importing in our project as `@typespec/http`.

## Using Custom Response Models in Operations

Now that we have defined our custom response models, let's use them in our API operations.

### Example: Applying Custom Response Models to Operations

```tsp tryit="{"emit": ["@typespec/openapi3"]}"
import "@typespec/http";
import "@typespec/versioning";

using TypeSpec.Http;
using TypeSpec.Versioning;

@service({
  title: "Pet Store",
})
@server("https://example.com", "Single server endpoint")
@versioned(Versions)
namespace PetStore;

enum Versions {
  v1: "1.0",
  v2: "2.0",
}

model Pet {
  id: int32;

  @minLength(1)
  name: string;

  @minValue(0)
  @maxValue(100)
  age: int32;

  kind: petType;
}

enum petType {
  dog: "dog",
  cat: "cat",
  fish: "fish",
  bird: "bird",
  reptile: "reptile",
}

@added(Versions.v2)
model Toy {
  id: int32;
  name: string;
}

model CommonParameters {
  @header
  requestID: string;

  @query
  locale?: string;

  @header
  clientVersion?: string;
}

// highlight-start
model PetListResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<Pet[]>;
}

model PetResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<Pet>;
}

model PetCreatedResponse {
  ...CreatedResponse;
  ...Body<Pet>;
}

model PetAcceptedResponse {
  ...AcceptedResponse;
  ...Body<Pet>;
}

model PetErrorResponse {
  ...BadRequestResponse;
  ...Body<ValidationError>;
}

model PetNotFoundResponse {
  ...NotFoundResponse;
  ...Body<NotFoundError>;
}

model PetUnauthorizedResponse {
  ...UnauthorizedResponse;
  ...Body<UnauthorizedError>;
}

model PetSuccessResponse {
  ...OkResponse;
  ...Body<string>;
}

model PetNoContentResponse {
  ...NoContentResponse;
}
// highlight-end

@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  @get
  // highlight-next-line
  op listPets(...CommonParameters): PetListResponse;

  @get
  // highlight-start
  op getPet(@path petId: int32, @header ifMatch?: string): PetResponse | PetNotFoundResponse;
  // highlight-end
  @useAuth(BearerAuth)
  @post
  // highlight-start
  op createPet(@body pet: Pet):
    | PetCreatedResponse
    | PetAcceptedResponse
    | PetErrorResponse
    | PetUnauthorizedResponse;
  // highlight-end

  @useAuth(BearerAuth)
  @put
  // highlight-start
  op updatePet(@path petId: int32, @body pet: Pet):
    | PetResponse
    | PetErrorResponse
    | PetUnauthorizedResponse
    | PetNotFoundResponse
    | InternalServerErrorResponse;
  // highlight-end

  @useAuth(BearerAuth)
  @delete
  // highlight-start
  op deletePet(@path petId: int32): PetNoContentResponse | PetUnauthorizedResponse;
  // highlight-end

  @route("{petId}/toys")
  namespace Toys {
    @added(Versions.v2)
    @get
    op listToys(@path petId: int32, ...CommonParameters): {
      @body toys: Toy[];
    };

    @added(Versions.v2)
    @post
    @useAuth(BearerAuth)
    op createToy(@path petId: int32, @body toy: Toy, ...CommonParameters): {
      @statusCode statusCode: 201;
      @body newToy: Toy;
    };

    @added(Versions.v2)
    @put
    @useAuth(BearerAuth)
    op updateToy(@path petId: int32, @path toyId: int32, @body toy: Toy, ...CommonParameters): {
      @body updatedToy: Toy;
    };

    @added(Versions.v2)
    @delete
    @useAuth(BearerAuth)
    op deleteToy(@path petId: int32, @path toyId: int32, ...CommonParameters): {
      @statusCode statusCode: 204;
    };
  }
}

@error
model NotFoundError {
  code: "NOT_FOUND";
  message: string;
}

@error
model ValidationError {
  code: "VALIDATION_ERROR";
  message: string;
  details: string[];
}

@error
model UnauthorizedError {
  code: "UNAUTHORIZED";
  message: string;
}

@error
model InternalServerError {
  code: "INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR";
  message: string;
}

model InternalServerErrorResponse {
  @statusCode statusCode: 500;
  @body error: InternalServerError;
}
```

In this example:

- The `listPets` operation uses the `PetListResponse` custom response model.
- The `getPet` operation uses the `PetResponse` and `PetNotFoundResponse` custom response models.
- The `createPet` operation uses the `PetCreatedResponse`, `PetAcceptedResponse`, `PetErrorResponse`, and `PetUnauthorizedResponse` custom response models.
- The `updatePet` operation uses the `PetResponse`, `PetErrorResponse`, `PetUnauthorizedResponse`, `PetNotFoundResponse`, and `InternalServerErrorResponse` custom response models.
- The `deletePet` operation uses the `PetNoContentResponse` and `PetUnauthorizedResponse` custom response models.

Note that we could also define custom response models for the `Toys` operations, similar to the `Pets` operations. But for brevity, we're omitting them in this example.

## Conclusion

In this section, we focused on creating custom response models in your REST API. By defining and extending custom response models, we can reduce duplication, improve readability, and minimize errors in our API responses. We also incorporated existing response models from the TypeSpec HTTP library to ensure consistency and clarity.
