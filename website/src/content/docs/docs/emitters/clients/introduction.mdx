## How to Use Emitters to Generate HTTP Clients from TypeSpec

### Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of using different client emitters (JavaScript, Python, Java, C#) to generate HTTP clients from TypeSpec. Please note that all client emitters are currently in **preview** and are subject to changes in future versions.

By following this guide, you will learn:

1. How to set up client emitters in `package.json`.
2. Update the client emitter configurations in `tspconfig.yaml`.
3. How to generate HTTP clients for each specific programming language.

## Location of All Client Emitters

The client emitters are defined in the `package.json` file within your project.

| **Emitter Name**             | **Language** | **Version**                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @typespec/http-client-js     | JavaScript   | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-js)     |
| @typespec/http-client-python | Python       | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-python) |
| @typespec/http-client-java   | Java         | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-java)   |
| @typespec/http-client-csharp | C#           | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-csharp) |

Below is an example of the `package.json` snippet where client emitters are defined:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/http-client-csharp": "^0.1.9-alpha.20250113.2",
    "@typespec/http-client-java": "^0.1.9",
    "@typespec/http-client-python": "^0.6.6",
    "@typespec/http-client-js": "^0.1.0",
  }
```

## Client Emitter Settings

This part provides an overview of the common and language-specific settings for each client emitter. These settings are stored in the `tspconfig.yaml` file.

### Common Configuration Options

The below option applies to all client emitters.

- `emitter-output-dir`: Defines where the generated SDK files will be stored.

### JavaScript Client Emitter Settings

JavaScript generally requires minimal configuration. However, it is recommended to provide `packageDetails` for package metadata, which is used in `package.json` and `README.md` files.

#### packageDetails

Provide the metadata for `package.json`, `README.md` information.

| Property    | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | Package name used in `package.json`                                    |
| description | Package description used in `package.json` file                        |
| version     | Detailed version for your package, the default value is `1.0.0-beta.1` |

Example configuration:

```yaml
packageDetails:
  name: "${your_package_name}"
  version: 1.0.0
```

### Java Client Emitter Settings

#### Prerequisites

Before using the Java client emitter, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Java 17 or later** - [Download here](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/download)  
  _(Verify installation with `java --version`)_
- **Maven** - [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)  
  _(Verify installation with `mvn --version`)_

### C# Client Emitter Settings

Before using the C# client emitter, ensure that the [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) (or higher) is installed.
Full configuration options can be found in the [C# Client Emitter README](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/blob/main/packages/http-client-csharp/readme.md#configuration)

## Running Language-Specific Emitters in CLI

<Steps>

1. Ensure that your package.json file is correctly configured to include the necessary dependencies for running the emitters

2. Update the tspconfig.yaml file for properly configured for the language-specific emitter.

   ```yaml
   emit:
     - "@typespec/http-client-csharp"
     - "@typespec/http-client-java"
     - "@typespec/http-client-python"
     - "@typespec/http-client-js"
   options:
     "@typespec/http-client-csharp":
       emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/dotnet"
     "@typespec/http-client-java":
       emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/java"
     "@typespec/http-client-python":
       emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/python"
     "@typespec/http-client-js":
       emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/javascript"
   ```

3. Once the package.json and tspconfig.yaml files are updated, you need to install all required dependencies by running the following command in the project root:

   ```bash
   tsp install
   ```

4. Run the emitter to compile your TypeScript code into the desired language. Use the following command to trigger the emitter and compile your project:

   ```bash
   tsp compile {path to main.tsp}/main.tsp
   ```

</Steps>

## Disclaimer

<Aside>

**All client emitters are in preview**. These emitters are actively being developed and may experience changes or updates that could affect their functionality. Please follow the official documentation for the latest updates.
