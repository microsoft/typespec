## How to Use Client Emitters to Generate SDK from TypeSpec

### Introduction

This guide will walk you through the process of using different client emitters (JavaScript, Python, Java, .NET) to generate SDKs from TypeSpec. Please note that all client emitters are currently in **preview** and are subject to changes in future versions.

By following this guide, you will learn:

1. How to set up and configure client emitters.
2. Update the client emitter configurations in `package.json` and `tspconfig.yaml`.
3. How to run the SDK generation for each specific programming language.

## Location of All Client Emitters

The client emitters are defined in the `package.json` file within your project.

| **Emitter Name**             | **Language** | **Version**                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| @azure-tools/typespec-ts     | JavaScript   | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@azure-tools/typespec-ts)     |
| @typespec/http-client-python | Python       | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-python) |
| @typespec/http-client-java   | Java         | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-java)   |
| @typespec/http-client-csharp | .NET         | ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@typespec/http-client-csharp) |

Below is an example of the `package.json` snippet where client emitters are defined:

```json
  "dependencies": {
    "@typespec/http-client-csharp": "^0.1.9-alpha.20250113.2",
    "@typespec/http-client-java": "^0.1.9",
    "@typespec/http-client-python": "^0.6.6",
    "@azure-tools/typespec-ts": "^0.38.1",
  }
```

## Client Emitter Settings

This part provides an overview of the common and language-specific settings for each client emitter. These settings are stored in the `tspconfig.yaml` file.

### Common Configuration Options

These options apply to all client emitters.

- `emitter-output-dir`: Defines where the generated SDK files will be stored.

### JavaScript Client Emitter Settings

JavaScript generally requires minimal configuration. However, it is recommended to provide `packageDetails` for package metadata, which is used in `package.json` and `README.md` files.

#### packageDetails

Provide the metadata for `package.json`, `README.md` information.

| Property    | Description                                                            |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name        | Package name used in `package.json`                                    |
| description | Package description used in `package.json` file                        |
| version     | Detailed version for your package, the default value is `1.0.0-beta.1` |

Example configuration:

```yaml
packageDetails:
  name: "${your_package_name}"
  version: 1.0.0
```

### Python Client Emitter Settings

No additional setting needed for Python.

### Java Client Emitter Settings

#### Prerequisites

Before using the Java client emitter, ensure the following dependencies are installed:

- **Java 17 or later** - [Download here](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/openjdk/download)  
  _(Verify installation with `java --version`)_
- **Maven** - [Download here](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)  
  _(Verify installation with `mvn --version`)_

#### Configuration Options

No additional setting needed for Java.

### .NET Client Emitter Settings

## Running Language-Specific Emitters in CLI

1. Ensure that your package.json file is correctly configured to include the necessary dependencies for running the emitters

2. Update the tspconfig.yaml file for properly configured for the language-specific emitter.

```yaml
emit:
  - "@typespec/http-client-csharp"
  - "@typespec/http-client-java"
  - "@typespec/http-client-python"
  - "@azure-tools/typespec-ts"
options:
  "@typespec/http-client-csharp":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/dotnet"
  "@typespec/http-client-java":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/java"
  "@typespec/http-client-python":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/python"
  "@azure-tools/typespec-ts":
    emitter-output-dir: "{project-root}/clients/javascript"
    packageDetails:
      name: "${your_package_name}"
      version: 1.0.0
```

3. Once the package.json and tspconfig.yaml files are updated, you need to install all required dependencies by running the following command in the project root:

```bash
tsp install
```

4. Run the emitter to compile your TypeScript code into the desired language. Use the following command to trigger the emitter and compile your project:

```bash
tsp compile {path to main.tsp}/main.tsp
```

## Disclaimer

<Aside>

**All client emitters are in preview**. These emitters are actively being developed and may experience changes or updates that could affect their functionality. Please follow the official documentation for the latest updates.
