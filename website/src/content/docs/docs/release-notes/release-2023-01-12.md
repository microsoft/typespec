## Breaking Changes

### `@typespec/openapi3` Default output-file is `openapi.yaml`

As the openapi3 emitter added support for serializing the openapi document to yaml it changed the default to emit yaml to `openapi.yaml`.

```yaml
options:
  @typespec/openapi3:
     file-type: json
```

or alternatively specify the name of the file you'd want

```yaml
options:
  @typespec/openapi3:
     output-file: custom.json
```

### [API] Templated operation inside interface

This breaking change affects libraries and emitters

- `templateArguments` property on templated type is deprecated and has been replaced with more detailed `templateMapper`

  If you where you using the `templateArgument` to find out if something was a template instance change

  ```ts
  type.templateArguments.length > 0;
  ```

  to

  ```ts
  isTemplateInstance(type);
  ```

- Interfaces might have some templated operations

  If blindly including all operations in an interface you might need to make sure the operation is not a template declaration first.

  For example with the following tsp code:

  ```typespec
  interface Factory {
    read<T>(): T;
    ping(): void;
  }
  ```

The emitter probably only wants to include the `ping()` operation but ignore read(). The `isTemplateDeclaration` helper can be used to filter out the template operations.
