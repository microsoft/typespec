## Values In TypeSpec

Decorators often expect some sort of configuration to be passed as an argument. In version `0.51.0` we introduced the `valueof` keyword to constrain a decorator or template parameter to be a value, however this was limited to string, numeric and boolean values.
When dealing with more complex decorators or free form data, one had to use a model type to represent the data. Unfortunately, this approach was difficult for decorator authors to handle reliably and required somewhat sophisticated validation to avoid some common pitfalls that couldn't be prevented through type system constraints.

In this release we introduce a new concept to TypeSpec: values. This includes new syntax for declaring object and array values, scalar constructors, and `const` declarations.

### Object values

Object values can be declared with the `#{}` syntax.

```tsp
const user = #{ name: "Bob", age: 48, address: #{ city: "London" } };
```

### Array values

Array values can be declared with the `#[]` syntax.

```tsp
const users = #["Bob", "Frank"];
```

### `const`

Const declares a variable that holds a value, and can optionally specify a type.

```tsp
const name = "Bob";
const name: string = "Bob";
```

### Scalar constructors

Scalars can define custom values with scalar value constructors. Scalars which don't extend a base type like `string`, `number` or `boolean` can define a constructor.

```tsp
scalar ipV4 {
  init fromInt(value: int32);
}
const ip: ipV4 = ipV4.fromInt(3232235776);
```

[See values doc for more info](https://typespec.io/docs/language-basics/values)

## Breaking changes

- [#3022](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/pull/3022) Addition of new `const` keyword means using `const` as a property name or decorator name will result in an error. This can be fixed by wrapping the property in backtick.

```tsp
model Test {
  // error
  const: string;

  // correct
  `const`: string;

}
```

## Deprecations

### @typespec/compiler

- [#3022](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/pull/3022) Using a tuple type as a value is deprecated. Tuple types in contexts where values are expected must be updated to be array values instead. A codefix is provided to automatically convert tuple types into array values.

```tsp
model Test {
  // Deprecated
  values: string[] = ["a", "b", "c"];

  // Correct
  values: string[] = #["a", "b", "c"];
}
```

- [#3022](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/pull/3022) Using a model type as a value is deprecated. Model types in contexts where values are expected must be updated to be object values instead. A codefix is provided to automatically convert model types into object values.

```tsp
model Test {
  // Deprecated
  user: {
    name: string;
  } = {
    name: "System";
  };

  // Correct
  user: {
    name: string;
  } = #{ name: "System" };
}
```

- [#3022](https://github.com/microsoft/typespec/pull/3022) Decorator API: Legacy marshalling logic

With the introduction of values, the decorator marshalling behavior has changed in some cases. This behavior is opt-in by setting the `valueMarshalling` package flag to `"new"`, but will be the default behavior in future versions. It is strongly recommended to adopt this new behavior as soon as possible.

Example:

```tsp
extern dec multipleOf(target: numeric | Reflection.ModelProperty, value: valueof numeric);
```

Will now emit a deprecated warning because `value` is of type `valueof string` which would marshall to `Numeric` under the new logic but as `number` previously.

To opt-in you can add the following to your library js/ts files.

```ts
export const $flags = definePackageFlags({
  decoratorArgMarshalling: "new",
});
```
