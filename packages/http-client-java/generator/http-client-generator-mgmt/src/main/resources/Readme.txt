## We'd love to hear your feedback

We're always working on improving our products and the way we communicate with our users. So we'd love to learn what's working and how we can do better.

If you haven't already, please take a few minutes to [complete this short survey][survey] we have put together.

Thank you in advance for your collaboration. We really appreciate your time!

## Documentation

Various documentation is available to help you get started

- [API reference documentation][docs]

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Java Development Kit (JDK)][jdk] with version 8 or above
- [Azure Subscription][azure_subscription]

### Adding the package to your product

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start;{{group-id}}:{{artifact-id}};current})
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>{{group-id}}</groupId>
    <artifactId>{{artifact-id}}</artifactId>
    <version>{{artifact-version}}</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

### Include the recommended packages

Azure Management Libraries require a `TokenCredential` implementation for authentication and an `HttpClient` implementation for HTTP client.

[Azure Identity][azure_identity] and [Azure Core Netty HTTP][azure_core_http_netty] packages provide the default implementation.

### Authentication

Microsoft Entra ID token authentication relies on the [credential class][azure_identity_credentials] from [Azure Identity][azure_identity] package.

Azure subscription ID can be configured via `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable.

Assuming the use of the `DefaultAzureCredential` credential class, the client can be authenticated using the following code:

```java
AzureProfile profile = new AzureProfile(AzureEnvironment.AZURE);
TokenCredential credential = new DefaultAzureCredentialBuilder()
    .authorityHost(profile.getEnvironment().getActiveDirectoryEndpoint())
    .build();
{{manager-class}} manager = {{manager-class}}
    .authenticate(credential, profile);
```

The sample code assumes global Azure. Please change `AzureEnvironment.AZURE` variable if otherwise.

See [Authentication][authenticate] for more options.

## Key concepts

See [API design][design] for general introduction on design and key concepts on Azure Management Libraries.
