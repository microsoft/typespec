/**
 * This tests:
 * - Simple bullet point. This bullet point is going to be very long to test how text wrapping is handled in bullet
 * points within documentation comments. It should properly indent the wrapped lines.
 * - Another bullet point with **bold text**. This bullet point is also intentionally long to see how the formatting is
 * preserved when the text wraps onto multiple lines in the generated documentation.
 * - Third bullet point with *italic text*. Similar to the previous points, this one is extended to ensure that the
 * wrapping and formatting are correctly applied in the output.
 * - Complex bullet point with **bold** and *italic* combined. This bullet point combines both bold and italic
 * formatting and is long enough to test the wrapping behavior in such cases.
 * - **Bold bullet point**: A bullet point that is entirely bolded. This point is also made lengthy to observe how the
 * bold formatting is maintained across wrapped lines.
 * - *Italic bullet point*: A bullet point that is entirely italicized. This final point is extended to verify that
 * italic formatting is correctly applied even when the text spans multiple lines.
