title: "[I] LineAndCharacter"

---
Identifies the position within a source file by line number and offset from
beginning of line.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `character` | `number` | The offset in UTF-16 code units to the character from the beginning of the line. 0-based. NOTE: This is not necessarily the same as what a given text editor might call the "column". Tabs, combining characters, surrogate pairs, and so on can all cause an editor to report the column differently. Indeed, different text editors report different column numbers for the same position in a given document. |
| `line` | `number` | The line number. 0-based. |
