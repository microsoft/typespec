## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `locateId?` | `boolean` | If trying to resolve the location of a type with an ID, show the location of the ID node instead of the entire type.<br />This makes sure that the location range is not too large and hard to read. |
