```ts
$sharedRoute(context, entity): void
```

`@sharedRoute` marks the operation as sharing a route path with other operations.

When an operation is marked with `@sharedRoute`, it enables other operations to share the same
route path as long as those operations are also marked with `@sharedRoute`.

`@sharedRoute` can only be applied directly to operations.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `context` | `DecoratorContext` |
| `entity` | `Operation` |

## Returns

`void`
