# TypeSpec CLI Standalone Package

This package contains the logic for building and bundling the TypeSpec CLI as a standalone executable.

It requires node 20+ to use node single executable. https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html

It is also possible to build with bun (code is there) but there is some issue due to signing. Goal will be to migrate to bun when those are resolved.
