Stop exposing APIs that were not meant for external users. Please file issue if you had legitmate use of some of those APIs.
  - `@includeInapplicableMetadataInPayload` decorator was moved to `Private` namespace and stop exposing the accessor.
  - Functions used in  `getHttpOperation` to resolve the finalized view of the http operation but shouldn't be used directly.
    - `resolvePathAndParameters`
  - `validateRouteUnique` internal api used in http library validation
  - Moved custom route producer related APIs to experimental with `unsafe_` prefix. Those APIs are not ready for public use and **will** change in future.
    - `DefaultRouteProducer` -> `unsafe_DefaultRouteProducer`
    - `getRouteProducer` -> `unsafe_getRouteProducer`
    - `setRouteProducer` -> `unsafe_setRouteProducer`
    - `setRouteOptionsForNamespace` -> `unsafe_setRouteOptionsForNamespace`
    - `RouteProducer` -> `unsafe_RouteProducer`
    - `RouteProducerResult` -> `unsafe_RouteProducerResult`
    - `RouteResolutionOptions` -> `unsafe_RouteResolutionOptions`
