Add discriminator support and polymorphic models strategy option

- Automatically injects discriminator property into base models with `@discriminator` decorator
- Marks discriminator property as required in generated schemas
- New `polymorphic-models-strategy` emitter option with three strategies:
  - `ignore`: Emit as regular object schema (default)
  - `oneOf`: Emit oneOf schema for closed discriminated unions
  - `anyOf`: Emit anyOf schema for open discriminated unions
- Includes discriminator.mapping in oneOf/anyOf schemas for improved validation
