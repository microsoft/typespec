## Linter versus `onValidate`

A TypeSpec library can provide an `$onValidate` hook, which can be used to validate whether the TypeSpec program is valid according to your library's rules.

On the other hand, a linter might provide optional validation. The program could be correct, but there might be room for improvements. For instance, a linter might require documentation on every type. While this isn't necessary to represent the TypeSpec program, it could enhance the end user experience. Linters need to be explicitly enabled, whereas `$onValidate` will run automatically if that library is imported.

## Creating a linter

You can find examples in `packages/best-practices`.

### 1. Define rules

```ts
import {  createLinterRule } from "@typespec/compiler";
import { reportDiagnostic } from "../lib.js";

export const requiredDocRule = createLinterRule({
  name: "no-model-doc",
  severity: "warning",
  // Short description of what this linter rule does. To be used for generated summary of a linter.
  description: "Enforce documentation on models.",
  messages: {
    default: `Must be documented.`,
    // Different messages can be provided
    models: `Models must be documented.`,

    // Message can be parameterized
    enums: paramMessage`Enum ${"enumName"} must be documented.`,
  },
  create(context) {
    return {
      operation: (op) => {
        if (!getDoc(context.program, op)) {
          context.reportDiagnostic({
            target: model,
          });
        }
      },
      model: (model) => {
        if (!getDoc(context.program, model)) {
          context.reportDiagnostic({
            messageId: "models",
            target: model,
          });
        }
      },
      enums: (type) => {
        if (!getDoc(context.program, type)) {
          context.reportDiagnostic({
            messageId: "enums",
            format: {enumName: type.name}
            target: model,
          });
        }
      },
    };
  },
});
```

#### Provide a codefix

[See codefixes](./codefixes.md) for more details on how codefixes work in the TypeSpec ecosystem.

In the same way you can provide a codefix on any reported diagnostic, you can pass codefixes to the `reportDiagnostic` function.

```ts
context.reportDiagnostic({
  messageId: "models",
  target: model,
  codefixes: [
    defineCodeFix({
      id: "add-model-suffix",
      label: "Add 'Model' suffix to model name",
      fix: (program) => {
        program.update(model, {
          name: `${model.name}Model`,
        });
      },
    }),
  ],
});
```

#### Things to avoid

- ❌ Do not call `program.reportDiagnostic` or your library `reportDiagnostic` helper directly in a linter rule

```ts
// ❌ Bad
program.reportDiagnostic({
  code: "other-code",
  target,
});
// ❌ Bad
reportDiagnostic(program, {
  code: "other-code",
  target,
});

// ✅ Good
context.reportDiagnostic({
  target,
});
```

### Register the rules

<!-- cspell:disable-next-line -->

Export a `$linter` variable from your library entrypoint:

```ts title="index.ts"
export { $linter } from "./linter.js";
```

```ts title="linter.ts"
import { defineLinter } from "@typespec/compiler";
// Import the rule defined previously
import { requiredDocRule } from "./rules/required-doc.rule.js";

export const $linter = defineLinter({
  // Include all the rules your linter is defining here.
  rules: [requiredDocRule],

  // Optionally a linter can provide a set of rulesets
  ruleSets: {
    recommended: {
      // (optional) A ruleset takes a map of rules to explicitly enable
      enable: { [`@typespec/my-linter/${requiredDocRule.name}`]: true },

      // (optional) A rule set can extend another rule set
      extends: ["@typespec/best-practices/recommended"],

      // (optional) A rule set can disable a rule enabled in a ruleset it extended.
      disable: {
        "`@typespec/best-practices/no-a": "This doesn't apply in this ruleset.",
      },
    },
  },
});
```

When referencing a rule or ruleset (in `enable`, `extends`, `disable`), you must use the rule or rule set id, which is in this format: `<libraryName>/<ruleName>`.

## Testing a linter

To test a linter rule, a rule tester is provided, allowing you to test a specific rule without enabling the others.

First, you'll want to create an instance of the rule tester using `createLinterRuleTester`, passing it the rule that is being tested. You can then provide different tests to check whether the rule passes or fails.

```ts
import { RuleTester, createLinterRuleTester, createTestRunner } from "@typespec/compiler/testing";
import { requiredDocRule } from "./rules/required-doc.rule.js";

describe("required-doc rule", () => {
  let ruleTester: RuleTester;

  beforeEach(() => {
    const runner = createTestRunner();
    ruleTester = createLinterRuleTester(runner, requiredDocRule, "@typespec/my-linter");
  });

  it("emit diagnostics when using model named foo", async () => {
    await ruleTester.expect(`model Foo {}`).toEmitDiagnostics({
      code: "@typespec/my-linter/no-foo-model",
      message: "Cannot name a model with 'Foo'",
    });
  });

  it("should be valid to use other names", async () => {
    await ruleTester.expect(`model Bar {}`).toBeValid();
  });
});
```

### Testing linter with codefixes

The linter rule tester provides an API to easily test a codefix. This is a different approach from the standalone codefix tester, which is more targeted at testing codefixes in isolation.

This can be done by calling `applyCodeFix` with the fix id. It will expect a single diagnostic to be emitted with a codefix with the given id. Then, call `toEqual` with the expected code after the codefix is applied.

:::note
When using multi-line strings (with `\``) in TypeScript, there is no de-indenting done, so you will need to make sure the input and expected result are aligned to the left.
:::

```ts
await tester
  .expect(
    `        
    model Foo {}
    `,
  )
  .applyCodeFix("add-model-suffix").toEqual(`
    model FooModel {}
  `);
```
