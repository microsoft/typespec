# Conclusion

## Recap of Key Concepts

Throughout this tutorial, we've covered a wide range of topics to help you build a comprehensive REST API using TypeSpec. Here's a brief recap of the main concepts we explored:

- **Setting Up the Environment**: We started by setting up the development environment and installing the necessary tools.
- **Defining Models and Services**: We learned how to define models and services using TypeSpec.
- **Creating and Organizing Namespaces**: We organized our API using namespaces to group related models and operations.
- **Defining HTTP Operations**: We defined various HTTP operations, including GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- **Handling Errors**: We created error models and custom response models to handle different types of errors.
- **Reusing Common Parameters**: We defined common parameters and reused them across multiple operations.
- **Adding Authentication**: We enforced authentication on specific operations using the `@useAuth` decorator.
- **Implementing Versioning**: We implemented versioning in our API using the `@versioned` and `@added` decorators.
- **Creating Custom Response Models**: We created custom response models to reduce duplication and improve readability.
