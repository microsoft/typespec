| Old Package Name      | New Package Name               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| @cadl-lang/compiler   | @typespec/compiler             |
| @cadl-lang/rest       | @typespec/rest, @typespec/http |
| @cadl-lang/migrate    | @typespec/migrate              |
| @cadl-lang/openapi    | @typespec/openapi              |
| @cadl-lang/openapi3   | @typespec/openapi3             |

libraries.

### Removed Support for Visual Studio 2019 in Visual Studio IDE extension

You must use a later version of Visual Studio

### Removed `emitters` option in configuration

Use `emit` and `options` instead
