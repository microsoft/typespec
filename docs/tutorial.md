# Introduction to API Definition Language (Cadl)

Cadl is a language for describing cloud service APIs and generating other API description languages, client and service code, documentation, and other assets. Cadl provides highly extensible core language primitives that can describe API shapes common among REST, GraphQL, gRPC, and other protocols.

Cadl is an object oriented dynamic language whose evaluation results in an object model describing service APIs. Unlike typical programming languages, Cadl consists primarily of declarations, however these declarations can be decorated to provide highly dynamic behavior.

Cadl's primary benefits include:

- Protocol agnostic: it can describe and generate code for APIs across multiple protocols and serialization languages
- Modular: developers can group common API shapes and conventions together and reuse them
- Terse: the syntax is expressive, capable of describing complex APIs with minimal code
- Extensible: developers can customize the language to describe just about any style of API

## Language Tour

Cadl consists of the following language features:

- Models: data shapes or schemas
- Type Literals: strings and numbers with specific values
- Type Operators: syntax for composing model types into other types
- Operations: service endpoints with parameters and return values
- Namespaces & Usings: groups models and operations together into hierarchical groups with friendly names
- Interfaces: groups operations
- Imports: links declarations across multiple files and libraries together into a single program
- Decorators: bits of TypeScript code that add metadata or sometimes mutate declarations
- Libraries: encapsulate Cadl definitions into reusable components

In addition, Cadl comes with a standard library for describing REST APIs and generating OpenAPI. Other protocol bindings are a work in progress!

### Models

Cadl models are used to describe data shapes or schemas. Models have any number of members and can extend and be composed with other models. Members are required by default, but can made optional by appending a "?" to the member name. A default value can also be provided with adding `= <value>` on an optional property.

The following defines a data shape with three members:

```cadl
model Dog {
  name: string;
  favoriteToy?: string;
  bestTreat?: string = "chicken";
}

```

#### Built-in Models

Cadl comes with built-in models for common data types:

- `string`: sequence of characters
- `bytes`: a sequence of bytes
- `int8`: 8-bit signed integer
- `int16`: 16-bit signed integer
- `int32`: 32-bit signed integer
- `int64`: 64-bit signed integer
- `uint8`: 8-bit unsigned integer
- `uint16`: 16-bit unsigned integer
- `uint32`: 32-bit unsigned integer
- `uint64`: 64-bit unsigned integer
- `safeint`: an integer that is safe to store in a IEEE754 double and safe to round trip through all JSON processors.
- `float32`: IEEE 754 single-precision floating point number
- `float64`: IEEE 754 double-precision floating point number
- `plainDate`: A date on a calendar without a time zone, e.g. "April 10th"
- `plainTime`: A time on a clock without a time zone, e.g. "3:00 am"
- `zonedDateTime`: A date and time in a particular time zone, e.g. "April 10th at 3:00am in PST"
- `duration`: A duration/time period. e.g 5s, 10h
- `boolean`: true or false
- `null`: the null value found in e.g. JSON.
- `Map<K, V>`: a map from K to V.

#### Spread

The spread operator takes the members of a source model and copies them into a target model. Spread doesn't create any nominal relationship between source and target, and so it's useful when you want to reuse common properties without reasoning about or generating complex inheritance relationships.

```cadl
model Animal {
  species: string;
}

model Pet {
  name: string;
}

model Dog {
  ...Animal;
  ...Pet;
}

// Dog is equivalent to the following declaration:
model Dog {
  species: string;
  name: string;
}

```

#### Extends

Sometimes you want to create an explicit relationship between two models, for example when you want to emit class definitions in languages which support inheritance. The `extends` keyword can be used to establish such a relationship.

```cadl
model Animal {
  species: string;
}

model Dog extends Animal {}

```

#### Is

Sometimes you want to copy all aspects of a type without creating a nominal inheritance relationship. The `is` keyword can be used for this purpose. It is like spread, but also copies [decorators](#Decorators) in addition to properties. One common use case is to give a better name to a [template](#Templates) instantiation:

```cadl
@decorator
model Thing<T> {
  property: T;
}

model StringThing is Thing<string> {}

// StringThing declaration is equivalent to the following declaration:
@decorator
model StringThing {
  property: string;
}

```

### Enums

Enums define a type which can hold one of a set of constant values.

```cadl
enum Color {
  Red,
  Blue,
  Green,
}

```

In this case, we haven't specified how the constants will be represented, allowing for different choices in different scenarios. For example, the OpenAPI emitter will choose string values "Red", "Green", "Blue". Another protocol might prefer to assign incrementing numeric values 0, 1, 2.

We can also specify explicit string or numeric values:

```cadl
enum Color {
  Red: "red",
  Blue: "blue",
  Green: "green",
}

enum Priority {
  High: 100,
  Low: 0,
}

```

#### Templates

It is often useful to let the users of a model fill in certain details. Model templates enable this pattern. Similar to generics found in other languages, model templates declare template parameters that users provide when referencing the model.

```cadl
model Page<T> {
  size: number;
  item: T[];
}

model DogPage {
  ...Page<Dog>;
}

```

A template parameter can be given a default value with `= <value>`.

```cadl
model Page<T = string> {
  size: number;
  item: T[];
}

```

#### Type Aliases

Sometimes it's convenient to alias a model template instantiation or type produced via type operators (covered later) as a convenient name. Aliases allow this:

```cadl
alias DogPage = Page<Dog>;

```

Unlike `model`, `alias` does not create a new entity, and as such will not change generated code in any way. An alias merely describes a source code shorthand to avoid repeating the right-hand side in multiple places.

### Type Literals

API authors often need to describe API shapes in terms of specific literal values. For example, this operation returns this specific integer status code, or this model member can be one of a few specific string values. It is also often useful to pass specific literal values to decorators. Cadl supports string, number, and boolean literal values to support these cases:

```cadl
model BestDog {
  name: "Suki";
  age: 14;
  best: true;
}

```

String literal types can also be created using the triple-quote syntax which enables multi-line strings:

```cadl
model Dog {
  favoriteFoods: """
    McDonalds
    Chipotle
    And so on
    """;
}

```

### Type Operators

Cadl supports a few type operators that make it easy to compose new models from other models.

#### Unions

Unions describe a type that must be exactly one of the union's constituents. Create a union with the `|` operator.

```cadl
alias GoodBreed = Beagle | GermanShepherd | GoldenRetriever;

```

##### Named unions

There is also a declaration syntax for naming a union and its options:

```cadl
union GoodBreed {
  beagle: Beagle,
  shepherd: GermanShepherd,
  retriever: GoldenRetriever,
}

```

The above example is equivalent to the `GoodBreed` alias above, except that emitters can actually see `GoodBreed` as a named entity and also see the `beagle`, `shepherd`, and `retriever` names for the options. It also becomes possible to apply [decorators](#Decorators) to each of the options when using this form.

#### Intersections

Intersections describe a type that must include all of the intersection's constituents. Create an intersection with the `&` operator.

```cadl
alias Dog = Animal & Pet;

```

#### Arrays

Arrays describe lists of things. Create an Array type with the `[]` operator.

```cadl
alias Pack = Dog[];

```

### Operations

Operations describe service endpoints and consist of an operation name, parameters, and return type. Operations are declared using the `op` keyword:

```cadl
op getDog(name: string): Dog;

```

The operation's parameters describe a model, so anything you can do in a model you can do in a parameter list as well, including using the spread operator:

```cadl
op getDog(...commonParams, name: string): Dog;

```

Often an endpoint point return one of any number of models. For example, there might be return type for when an item is found, and a return type for when an item isn't found. Unions are used to describe this pattern:

```cadl
model DogNotFound {
  error: "Not Found";
}

op getDog(name: string): Dog | DogNotFound;

```

### Namespaces & Usings

Namespaces let you group related types together into namespaces. This helps organize your types making them easier to find and prevents name conflicts. Namespaces are merged across files, so you can reference any type anywhere in your Cadl program via its namespace. You can create namespace blocks like the following:

```cadl
namespace Models {
  model Dog {}
}

op getDog(): Models.Dog;

```

You can also put an entire Cadl file into a namespace by using the blockless namespace syntax:

```cadl
// models.cadl
namespace Models;
model Dog {}

```

```cadl
// main.cadl
import "./models.cadl";
op getDog(): Models.Dog;

```

Namespace declarations can declare multiple namespaces at once by using a dotted member expression. There's no need to declare nested namespace blocks if you don't want to.

```cadl
namespace A.B;
namespace C.D {

}
namespace C.D.E {
  model M {}
}

alias M = A.B.C.D.E.M;

```

It can be convenient to add references to a namespace's declarations to your local namespace, especially when namespaces can become deeply nested. The `using` statement lets us do this:

```cadl
// models.cadl
namespace Service.Models;
model Dog {}

```

```cadl
// main.cadl
import "./models.cadl";
using ServiceModels;
op getDog(): Dog; // here we can use Dog directly.

```

The bindings introduced by a `using` statement are local to the namespace they are declared in. They do not become part of the namespace themselves.

```cadl
namespace Test {
  model A {}
}

namespace Test2 {
  using Test;
  alias B = A; // ok
}

alias C = Test2.A; // not ok
alias C = Test2.B; // ok

```

### Interfaces

Interfaces can be used to group operations.

```cadl
interface A {
  a(): string;
}

interface B {
  b(): string;
}

```

And the keyword `mixes` can be used to compose operations from other interfaces into a new interface:

```cadl
interface C mixes A, B {
  c(): string;
}

// C is equivalent to the following declaration
interface C {
  a(): string;
  b(): string;
  c(): string;
}

```

### Imports

Imports add files or libraries to your Cadl program. When you compile an Cadl file, you provide a path to your root Cadl file, by convention called "main.cadl". From there, any files you import are added to your program. If you import a directory, Cadl will look for a `main.cadl` file inside that directory.

The path you import must either begin with "./" or "../" or otherwise be an absolute path. The path must either refer to a directory, or else have an extension of either ".cadl" or ".js". The following demonstrates how to use imports to assemble an Cadl program from multiple files:

```cadl
// main.cadl
import "./models";
op getDog(): Dog;

```

```cadl
// models/main.cadl
import "./dog.cadl";

```

```cadl
// models/dog.cadl
namespace Models;
model Dog {}

```

### Decorators

Decorators enable a developer to attach metadata to types in an Cadl program. They can also be used to calculate types based on their inputs. Decorators are the backbone of Cadl's extensibility and give it the flexibility to describe many different kinds of APIs and associated metadata like documentation, constraints, samples, and the like.

Many Cadl constructs can be decorated, including namespaces, operations and their parameters, and models and their members.

Decorators are defined using JavaScript functions that are exported from a standard ECMAScript module. When you import a JavaScript file, Cadl will look for any exported functions, and make them available as decorators inside the Cadl syntax. When a decorated declaration is evaluated by Cadl, it will invoke the decorator function, passing along a reference to the current compilation, an object representing the type it is attached to, and any arguments the user provided to the decorator.

Decorators are attached by adding the decorator before the element you want to decorate, prefixing the name of the decorator with `@`. Arguments can be provided by using parentheses in a manner similar to many programming languages, e.g. `@dec(1, "hi", { a: string })`. The parentheses can be omitted when no arguments are provided.

The following shows an example of declaring and then using a decorator:

```js
// model.js
export function logType(compilation, targetType, name) {
  console.log(name + ": " + targetType.kind);
}
```

```cadl
// main.cadl
import "./model.js";

@logType("Dog type")
model Dog {
  @logType("Name type")
  name: string;
}

```

After running this Cadl program, the following will be printed to the console:

```
Name type: ModelProperty
Dog type: Model
```

#### Built-in decorators

Cadl comes built-in with a number of decorators that are useful for defining service APIs regardless of what protocol or language you're targeting.

- @doc - attach a documentation string. Works great with multi-line string literals.
- @tag - attach a simple tag to a declaration
- @secret - mark a string as a secret value that should be treated carefully to avoid exposure
- @minValue/@maxValue - set the min and max values of number types
- @minLength/@maxLength - set the min and max lengths for strings
- @pattern - set the pattern for a string using regular expression syntax

##### Visibility decorators

Additionally, the decorators `@withVisibility` and `@visibility` provide an extensible visibility framework that allows for defining a canonical model with fine-grained visibility flags and derived models that apply those flags. Flags can be any string value and so can be customized to your application. Also, `@visibility` can take multiple string flags to set multiple flags at once, and `@withVisibility` can take multiple string flags to filter on at once.

Consider the following example:

```cadl
model Dog {
  // the service will generate an ID, so you dont need to send it.
  @visibility("read") id: int32;
  // the service will store this secret name, but won't ever return it
  @visibility("write") secretName: string;
  // no flags are like specifying all flags at once, so in this case
  // equivalent to @visibility("read", "write")
  name: string;
}

// The spread operator will copy all the properties of Dog into ReadDog,
// and withVisibility will remove any that don't match the current
// visibility setting
@withVisibility("read")
model ReadDog {
  ...Dog;
}

@withVisibility("write")
model WriteDog {
  ...Dog;
}

```

### Libraries

Cadl libraries are bundles of useful Cadl declarations and decorators into reusable packages. Cadl libraries are actually npm packages under the covers. Official Cadl libraries can be found with the `@cadl-lang/` or `@azure-tools/cadl-` npm package name prefix. Libraries can be either a language library, an emitter library or both.

#### Setting up Cadl library

The first step in using a library is to install it via `npm`. You can get `npm` and `node` from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org).

If you haven't already initialized your Cadl project's package.json file, now would be a good time to do so. The package.json file lets you track the dependencies your project depends on, and is a best practice to check in along with any Cadl files you create. Run `npm init` create your package.json file.

Then, in your Cadl project directory, type `npm install libraryName` to install a library. For example, to install the official Cadl REST API bindings and OpenAPI generator, you would type `npm install @cadl-lang/rest @cadl-lang/openapi3`.

#### Using language libraries

Lastly, you need to import the libraries into your Cadl program. By convention, all external dependencies are imported in your `main.cadl` file, but can be in any Cadl file imported into your program. Importing the two libraries we installed above would look like this:

```cadl
// in main.cadl
import "@cadl-lang/rest";
import "@cadl-lang/openapi3";

```

#### Using emitter libraries

The emitter needs to be referenced either via the cli `--emit` option or configured in the CADL config file.

```bash
# Run openapi3 emitter on the spec
cadl compile . --emit=@cadl-lang/openapi3
```

or in the config file `cadl-project.yaml`

```yaml
emitters:
  "@cadl-lang/openapi3": true
```

#### Creating libraries

Creating an Cadl library is essentially the same as creating any NPM library. [Consult the official documentation for more info](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-node-js-modules). `main` should refer to a JS file that exports all your library's decorators and helper utilities.

The package.json file for an Cadl library requires one additional field: `cadlMain`, which refers to the root file of your Cadl program similar to how `main` refers to the root of a JS program. If you don't have any Cadl declarations, `cadlMain` can be identical to `main`.

### REST APIs

With the language building blocks we've covered so far we're ready to author our first REST API. Cadl has an official REST API "binding" called `@cadl-lang/rest`. It's a set of Cadl declarations and decorators that describe REST APIs and can be used by code generators to generate OpenAPI descriptions, implementation code, and the like.

Cadl also has an official OpenAPI emitter called `@cadl-lang/openapi3` that consumes the REST API bindings and emits standard OpenAPI descriptions. This can then be fed in to any OpenAPI code generation pipeline.

The following examples assume you have imported both `@cadl-lang/openapi3` and `@cadl-lang/rest` somewhere in your Cadl program (though importing them in `main.cadl` is the standard convention).

#### Service definition and metadata

A definition for a service is the namespace that contains all the operations for the service and carries top-level metadata like service name and version. Cadl offers the following decorators for providing this metadata, and all are optional.

- @serviceTitle - the title of the service
- @serviceVersion - the version of the service. Can be any string, but later version should lexicographically sort after earlier versions
- @produces - the content types the service may produce
- @consumes - the content types that may be sent to the service

Here's an example that uses these to define a Pet Store service:

```cadl
@serviceTitle("Pet Store Service")
@serviceVersion("2021-03-25")
@doc("This is a sample server Petstore server.")
@Cadl.Rest.produces("application/json", "image/png")
@Cadl.Rest.consumes("application/json")
namespace PetStore;

```

#### Resources & routes

Resources are operations that are grouped in a namespace. You declare such a namespace by adding the `@route` decorator to provide the path to that resource:

```cadl
using Cadl.Http;

@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {

}

```

To define an operation on this resource, you need to provide the HTTP verb for the route using the `@get`, `@head` `@post`, `@put`, `@patch`, or `@delete` decorators. Alternatively, you can name your operation `list`, `create`, `read`, `update`, `delete`, or `deleteAll` and the appropriate verb will be used automatically. Lets add an operation to our `Pets` resource:

```cadl
@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(): Pet[];

  // or you could also use
  @get op listPets(): Pet[];
}

```

#### Path and query parameters

Model properties and parameters which should be passed as path and query parameters use the `@path` and `@query` parameters respectively. Let's modify our list operation to support pagination, and add a read operation to our Pets resource:

```cadl
@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(@query skip: int32, @query top: int32): Pet[];
  op read(@path petId: int32): Pet;
}

```

Path parameters are appended to the URL unless a substitution with that parameter name exists on the resource path. For example, we might define a sub-resource using the following Cadl. Note how the path parameter for our sub-resource's list operation corresponds to the substitution in the URL.

```cadl
@route("/pets/{petId}/toys")
namespace PetToys {
  op list(@path petId: int32): Toy[];
}

```

#### Request & response bodies

Request and response bodies are declared using the `@body` decorator. Let's add an endpoint to create a pet. Let's also use this decorator for the responses, although this doesn't change anything about the API.

```cadl
@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(@query skip: int32, @query top: int32): {
    @body pets: Pet[];
  };
  op read(@path petId: int32): {
    @body pet: Pet;
  };
  op create(@body pet: Pet): {};
}

```

#### Polymorphism with discriminators

A pattern often used in REST APIs is to define a request or response body as having one of several different shapes, with a property called the
"discriminator" indicating which actual shape is used for a particular instance.
Cadl supports this pattern with the `@discriminator` decorator of the Rest library.

The `@discrminator` decorator takes one argument, the name of the discriminator property, and should be placed on the
model for the request or response body. The different shapes are then defined by separate models that `extend` this request or response model.
The discriminator property is defined in the "child" models with the value or values that indicate an instance that conforms to its shape.

As an example, a `Pet` model that allows instances that are either a `Cat` or a `Dog` can be defined with

```cadl
@discriminator("kind")
model Pet {
  name: string;
  weight?: float32;
}
model Cat extends Pet {
  kind: "cat";
  meow: int32;
}
model Dog extends Pet {
  kind: "dog";
  bark: string;
}

```

#### Headers

Model properties and parameters that should be passed in a header use the `@header` decorator. The decorator takes the header name as a parameter. If a header name is not provided, it is inferred from the property or parameter name. Let's add `etag` support to our pet store's read operation.

```cadl
@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(@query skip: int32, @query top: int32): {
    @body pets: Pet[];
  };
  op read(@path petId: int32, @header ifMatch?: string): {
    @header eTag: string;
    @body pet: Pet;
  };
  op create(@body pet: Pet): {};
}

```

#### Status codes

Use the `@header` decorator on a property named `statusCode` to declare a status code for a response. Generally, setting this to just `int32` isn't particularly useful. Instead, use number literal types to create a discriminated union of response types. Let's add status codes to our responses, and add a 404 response to our read endpoint.

```cadl
@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(@query skip: int32, @query top: int32): {
    @statusCode statusCode: 200;
    @body pets: Pet[];
  };
  op read(@path petId: int32, @header ifMatch?: string): {
    @statusCode statusCode: 200;
    @header eTag: string;
    @body pet: Pet;
  } | {
    @statusCode statusCode: 404;
  };
  op create(@body pet: Pet): {
    @statusCode statusCode: 200;
  };
}

```

#### Built-in response shapes

Since status codes are so common for REST APIs, Cadl comes with some built-in types for common status codes so you don't need to declare status codes so frequently. Lets update our sample one last time to use these built-in response types:

```cadl
model OkResponseWithETag<T> {
  ...OkResponse<T>;
  @header eTag: string;
}

@route("/pets")
namespace Pets {
  op list(@query skip: int32, @query top: int32): OkResponse<Pet[]>;
  op read(@path petId: int32, @header ifMatch?: string): OkResponseWithETag<Pet> | NotFoundResponse;
  op create(@body pet: Pet): OkResponse<{}>;
}

```

### CADL Config

Cadl has a configuration file `cadl-project.yaml` that right now is only used to configure the default emitter to use.
The config file needs to be a sibling of the `package.json`. Cadl will look for the following files in that order and pick the 1st one found:

Configuration schema:

```yaml
# Map of the default emitters to use when not using `--emit`
emitters:
  <emitterName>: true
```
